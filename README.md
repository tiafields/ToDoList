# To Do List Application
This application serves as a Task Management tool, enabling users to input tasks through a text field and submit them using either the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key on their keyboard. Users can then mark tasks as complete by selecting them or clicking the circle to the left, which results in the task being visually crossed out and with a checkmark indicating completion. To remove a task entirely, users can click the "X" to the right. Task data persists in the browser until the user chooses to delete it, ensuring ongoing accessibility and convenience.
